It has been detected in the emissions from automobile exhaust, liquid floor wax, steel protective paints, and from trees. It also has been identified in urban and rural air samples, Chickpea seed, and in human adipose tissue. If released to soil, methacrolein will have very high mobility. Volatilization of methacrolein will be important from moist and dry soil surfaces. Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of methacrolein in soil or water. If released to water, methacrolein may not adsorb to suspended solids and sediment. Methacrolein may volatilize from water surfaces with estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake of about 5 hours and 4 days, respectively. An estimated BCF value of 1.4 suggests that methacrolein will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms. If released to the atmosphere, methacrolein will exist in the vapor phase. Vapor-phase methacrolein is degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with photochemically produced hydroxyl radicals with an estimated half-life of about 11.5 hours. Vapor-phase methacrolein is also degraded in the atmosphere by reaction with ozone with an estimated half-life of about 10.5 days. Methacrolein reacts very quickly in air with oxygen forming peroxides and acids. Methacrolein is formed from the gas-phase reaction of ozone with isoprene. Exposure to methacrolein may occur through dermal contact and inhalation. (SRC)",

Methacrolein may volatilize from water surfaces based on an estimated Henry's Law constant of 2.86X10-4 atm-cu m/mole(SRC), calculated from experimental values of vapor pressure(4) and water solubility(2). Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 5 hours and 4 days, respectively(3,SRC). An estimated BCF value of 1.4(3,SRC), from an experimental water solubility(2), suggests that methacrolein will not bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC) according to a recommended classification scheme(5). Insufficient data are available to determine the rate or importance of biodegradation of methacrolein in water(SRC).",
